        external facility performing functions
        on behalf of insurance carriers, such as underwriting,
        product development, business acquisition, and program management.</h2>
      <p>Innovation is paramount to business success; Nevaeh provides
        an outlet for insurance carrier partners to explore new ways
        of doing business without disrupting existing operations.</p>
      <p>It is difficult for many companies to go from concept to
        execution. Nevaeh allows an organization to test and learn
        before making a commitment and investment in new ideas.</p>
      <p>Many insurance companies like to talk about their innovation
        strategies but fall short for many reasons. </p>
